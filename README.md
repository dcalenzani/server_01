# SERVER_01
If you've seen the Animatrix you might know that the free nation of the machines is called 01. This project wasn't inspired on that name, but I like the coincidence since ChatGPT really helped with some stuff. In my perspective, the different advancements in learning models are being hugely misenderstood by educators and politicians, and while the matrix scenario might be a stretch, the truth is that we are closer to making the machines our enemies than our allies. So lets keep sharing our code so we can use different tools to understand it, and lets improve this tools so we can correctly cite and honor the concept of creation.

## MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

1. Node js: Install it through [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](Node Version Manager), this way if you create other projects with other teams in the future you can safely change node versions. If you are using Windows it might be a hastle, but you've got Windows tools such as [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](WSL-Windows Subsystem Linux) that will let you use the Linux BASH and access tools as wget to easen up the install.
2. NextJs 13: pretty straightforward install after npm. If you've never used it before read more [https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation](here).
3. PostgreSQL: SQL 

## INSTRUCTIONS

Download the project through the link provided in the GitHub directory (where you are now). Go to your command line of prefference and navigate to the nextJs directory. This would be something like 
    cd ~/path/to/the/directory
After this, run
    npm install
this will install all the dependencies for the project. Now try using
    npx next dev
You'll see that the localhost starts working in port 3000.
