# Dropplet is born
Yeah, it is still small and relatively non innovative. The only real difference with smaller projects is the launching from an independent server, which was really troublesome and perhaps less efficient. However, Dropplet is born to be a tool for the people, and as such it need to work toward independency in every sense. In the current talk around technology few is said about the energy challenges and hardware inequalities in the field, specially when talking about data science in the public sphere. A free(er) world needs to have independent data sources for everyone, and why not start with something as easy as homegrowing plants?
