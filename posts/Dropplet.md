# Dropplet is born
Yeah, it is still small and relatively non innovative. The only real difference with smaller projects is the launching from an independent server, which was really troublesome and perhaps less efficient. However, Dropplet is born to be a tool for the people, and as such it need to work toward independency in every sense. In the current talk around technology few is said about the energy challenges and hardware inequalities in the field, specially when talking about data science in the public sphere. A free(er) world needs to have independent data sources for everyone, and why not start with something as easy as homegrowing plants?

I saw many vids when making dropplet, specially on the sensors and type of communications involved, while this is still a prototype I expect it to grow into a free and open source for developing even bigger autonomous gardens. 

An important part of Dropplet was making it closer to users so they could replicate it for their homes easily not being dependant on services like Firebase or other similar. 

I thank this video for teaching me how to do a gauge in css, which was essential for displaying stuff without using more libraries (I'm getting tired of just downloading stuff withouth knowing what it does) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnUkVcQ_3CQ
