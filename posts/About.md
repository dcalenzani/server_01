# A short manifesto about my work.

*I'm an anthropologist in search for open integration between human and computational science.*

I did my bachelor's degree at PUCP, a private catholic college in Peru. By the end of my studies I started working in the public sector first as an undergrad then as a graduate. Then, I searched for an opportunity to delve into the private sector, and became a research analyst for qualitative and quantitative studies at Marketing Analytics. I learnt a lot as an analyst, about power, workforce, organizations, innovation, money, operations, systems and many of the formalities that come inbetween.
