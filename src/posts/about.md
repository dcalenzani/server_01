# A short manifesto about my work.

Hi! I'm Daniel Alfonso Calenzani Bravo, but I prefer Dani or Calenzani. I'm a proffesional cultural anthropologist in search for open integration between human and computational science. 

I did my bachelor's degree at PUCP, a private catholic college in Peru. By the end of my studies I started working in the public sector for a short time, first as an undergrad and then as a graduate intern. Then I decided to research into the private world, working in the marketing field as a research analyst for different firms. I learnt a lot as an analyst (and some would say "researcher", but I decline this term), about power, about workforce, about organizations, workflows, money, operations, systems and much formalities inbetween. I also learned a lot about managing data. 

In this journey I also re-developed my love for statistics and electronics. I started learning Python, SQL and C++, soon I learned about how much raw data you can process in just some seconds if you use these instead of something like Excel or Atlas.Ti. Of course, these coding tools had a somewhat steep learning curve, specially if you where unable to speak english, but they prove to be appropriate for all kinds of analysis when my team was tasked with a research centered around the behaviour of consumers, our data was massive for our experience, with more than 10 million cases distributed between 6 countries and 3 months. We had never experienced this amount of work, more resources where alocated to our team so we could tackle the challenge, but our regular tools where not enought. I started using my really recent knowledge around SQL and quickly we could gathered some insights around our data. 

I loved the rush of programming towards a goal, finding small things in the data. My whole career in anthropology had been epistemological questions around what constitutes data, programming seemed like an eerie familiar place, every problem had a data type and a form of handling data, just as society and different cultures had their own data flows. 

In the begining most of philosophers and social thinkers where also mathematicians, science was not divorced as not "divorced" as it is nowadays. However, how can we re-mary science to produce a new holistic offspring? Just by the understanding of both fields at a deep level. As an anthropologist nowadays I'm on my own PATH, currently I'm working as a private analyst and developer, with a focus on digital analysis. On a personal level I'm part of a group of an independent group young researchers for data science learning, there I also have some research done which can be seen on our site.

I also have Dropplet, a small home plant monitor with an smart drip irrigation system. Its still in diapers but I wish to see it grow.
