# Small Shop

My own iteration of an E-Commerce using NextJs, Tailwind and Typescript, adapting the code from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgPcpte1eoA) when needed (most of it is a copy paste, but previous API work helps).
Thanks a lot to Thirus for her video too, as [her responsive grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aQ6nFMsbDs) was implemented in this project too!

## Use scenarios

Many small bussiness owners struggle on going online. Furthermore, they struggle with just using a computers. One of the main hooks of Windows as an operating system is the no-code approach they took in excel, going as far as some people calling their excel sheets a "database".

Well, in inspirition of this atrocity, and as argumented by Goncy on his video, lets use Google Sheets to administer an E-commerce online, no training needed on new tools for your administrators when trying to update items and no more hassles.

## Caution

This is a static site, its not actually connected to a database, and works since most small (MYPE) stores use whatsapp, specially in Latin America. However, safety and scalation will be a concern if you stay in this system for too long, but migrations could be done easily.
