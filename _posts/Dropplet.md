# Dropplet is born

Dropplet is a system designed for gathering and sharing data around plants, while tracking your watering and environmental values. It has the added function of automatic watering, based on reading of a soil humidity sensor. 

You'll find different projects with similar objectives. Dropplet however intends from the beggining to be a fully fledged ecosystem where gardeners and plant enthusiasts share their growth data with other fellows around the world.

## Current state of Dropplet

The server works at a home level, but since the API is still closed to the public I'll rework the main page to show the project updates, circuit maps and other experiences.
